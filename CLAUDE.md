# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Important: Read Documentation First

**ALWAYS read all documents in the `documents/` directory when starting work on this project.** This directory contains:
- `concept.md`: Project concept and feature specifications (Korean)
- `tech-spec.md`: Technical specifications with Flutter and Supabase architecture
- `design-system.md`: Complete design system with colors, typography, and component styles

These documents provide essential context for understanding the project requirements, technical decisions, and design consistency.

## Project Overview

This is the "blinddate" project - a Korean dating app MVP with the following core features:
- Daily recommendation of 1 person per user
- Country-based matching (same country users only)
- Admin approval-based registration system
- Basic DM functionality with premium real-time chat
- Phone verification and profile-based registration

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Flutter (Cross-platform mobile app)
- **Language**: Dart
- **Backend**: Supabase (BaaS)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (via Supabase)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with phone verification
- **Real-time**: Supabase Realtime for chat
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage for profile images

## Project Status

This is a new project repository with initial documentation. The project will be built as a Flutter mobile application with Supabase backend.

## Architecture Notes

Based on the concept document (documents/concept.MD), the app will follow this flow:
1. User registration ‚Üí Phone verification ‚Üí Profile creation ‚Üí Admin approval
2. Daily matching system showing 1 recommendation per day

## Design Guidelines

**CRITICAL**: Always follow the design system (design-system.md) for visual consistency:
- Use the defined color palette (primary: #2D3142, accent: #EF476F)
- Apply consistent spacing system (xs:4, sm:8, md:16, lg:24, xl:32, xxl:48)
- Follow typography hierarchy (H1/H2/H3 for headings, Body1/Body2 for content)
- Use minimal, clean design with plenty of whitespace
- Implement consistent component styles (buttons, cards, inputs)
- Maintain "Minimal Elegance" design philosophy throughout

## Development Approach

Since this is a mobile dating app MVP, development should prioritize:
1. Core user flow (registration ‚Üí matching ‚Üí basic communication)
2. Admin approval system for content moderation
3. Basic monetization features
4. Country-specific expansion capabilities
